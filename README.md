Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9. 
 # input grid
 
 grid = [[2, 5, 0, 0, 3, 0, 9, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],
    [4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8],
    [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 3, 6, 0, 0, 7, 2],
    [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [9, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 4]]
